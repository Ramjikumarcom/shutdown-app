# shutdown: This is the command used to control shutdown, restart, or logoff operations in Windows.
"""
"shutdown -l":
The shutdown command is commonly used in operating systems (like Windows or Unix-based systems) to perform shutdown-related operations, 
including logging off, shutting down, or rebooting the system.
-l is a specific flag that means "log off" the current user.
"""
"""
The shutdown command (and particularly -l for logging off) is platform-dependent. 
The behavior of shutdown -l works on Windows. In Unix/Linux, there are similar commands,
 but shutdown -l wouldnâ€™t log off the user; instead,
 you'd typically use a different command like logout or exit.

# making function of all the function
def restart():
    os.system("shutdown /r /t 1")

"""
/r: This switch tells the system to "restart" instead of shutting down. Without this, 
the shutdown command would simply shut down the system.

/t 1: This option sets the time delay before the restart occurs. The number after /t is the delay in seconds. 
In this case, it is set to 1 second, meaning the system will restart 1 second after the command is issued.
